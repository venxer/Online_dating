When printing profiles and likes, the users should stay in the original order as they are in the input files.

When printing matches, the users should be sorted in an increasing order based on their phone numbers, which should be a std::string type. For example, the user whose number is "765-651-1171" comes after the user whose number is "569-933-6508".
